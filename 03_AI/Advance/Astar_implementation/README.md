# Problem Statement
- The objective is to create a program that generates a random maze and visualizes the process of solving it using the A* pathfinding algorithm. 
- The maze should be dynamically generated, and the program should use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point. 
- Additionally, the solving process should be saved as a video, where the pathfinding steps and the final path are visualized in different colors.
- Once you are done with this, now write another program that will implement A* algorithm but the maze will taken as an input from the user.
