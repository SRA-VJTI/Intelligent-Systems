#### **Write a Python program to simulate the behavior of the following agents:**

- Simple Reflex Agent: A thermostat that turns the heater ON or OFF based on the current temperature. Threshold = $22^\circ C$
- Model-Based Agent: A robot vacuum that remembers the state of the room (clean or dirty) and updates its knowledge after cleaning.
- Goal-Based Agent: A robot navigating a 3x3 maze to reach the goal position. Robot can move in 4 directions(Left, Right, Up, Down)
- Utility-Based Agent: A delivery drone choosing the shortest path to deliver a package out of many packages. 

I have completed the [C++ implementation](./main.cpp) of this assignment for you. Your task is to implement the same functionality in Python. Once you complete the assignment, submit a pull request (PR) by adding your main.py file to this folder.

All the best!

- In order to compile the C++ implementation of problem, run `make all` and then execute the files.
