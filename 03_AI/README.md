## Introduction

- In 01_ButwhatIsAI -> We start by discussing why we need AI. Next, we explore the different types of agents in AI.
- In 02_search and 03_problemOfLocalOptima -> We then delve into the problem-solving aspects of AI, learning various search algorithms. Afterward, we examine the challenges these search algorithms face, such as the problem of local maxima, and study different algorithms designed to avoid local maxima and reach the global maxima.
- In 04_gamePlaying -> We learn about game playing.

-> The history of games in AI is extensive. Let's see how they have contributed to the development of AI.

### History of Game Playing

- Games are a great way to understand intelligence and strategy. Chess, originating in India, has long been a tool for developing strategic thinking.
- In AI, games provide controlled environments with clear rules and measurable outcomes, making them ideal for studying decision-making.
- Early breakthroughs, like Arthur Samuel’s checkers program and IBM’s Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, showcased the power of AI in handling complex tasks.
- Games also help us explore how multiple agents interact, forming the foundation of game theory pioneered by John von Neumann. They are a perfect starting point for learning AI and strategy.

### Implementation

-> While learning all this, we will also work on various implementations, such as:

- Implementing different Intelligent Agents for different scenarios.
- Solving the 8-puzzle problem using various search algorithms such as DFS, BFS, and BestFS, with two different heuristics.
- Solving the 3-SAT problem using algorithms like Hill Climbing, Iterative Hill Climbing (IHC), and Variable Neighborhood Descent, which aim to reach the global maxima.
- Writing a game-playing algorithm for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

### Additional Resources

We have also provided a few advanced concepts in PDF format, including:

- A\* Algorithm
- Rule-Based Systems
- Planning Algorithms

These advanced topics are not compulsory but are highly recommended for those learning AI out of passion and curiosity!
